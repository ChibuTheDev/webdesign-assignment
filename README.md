# Time table management system

This is a minimal project that allows admins to set time and venues for classes in
a school and allows students to view their timetbles. I did it in collaboration with my coursemates and some other cs students. 

Even though we procrastinated on building it till the last minute, it was actually fun to build and present. Thanks to everyone who worked on it and to Dr Jerry for giving the assignment :)
